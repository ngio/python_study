Hereâ€™s how you can generate a one-time password (OTP) using Python:


How It Works:
Generate Digits:

random.randint(0, 9) generates a random digit between 0 and 9.
A list comprehension repeats this length times, creating a list of digits.
Combine Digits:

''.join() combines the digits into a single string.
Length Validation:

If a non-positive length is passed, an exception is raised.


Custom OTP Features:
Length: Adjust length to make shorter or longer OTPs.
Type: Choose numeric, alphanumeric, or even symbols by modifying the character set.
Security: Use the secrets module for cryptographically secure random numbers.
